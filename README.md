This is a smart, AI-powered Resume Ranking System that simulates an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**. It allows recruiters or hiring teams to **upload multiple resumes** and **paste a job description**, and then **ranks resumes** based on similarity using **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**.

Built with 🧠 `scikit-learn` and ⚡️ `Streamlit` for interactive UI.
